# HW3_Password_Generator

The Purpose of the assginment was to build this darn password generator.
Now I gotta tell ya, this one was a doozy... Sooo it doesn't actually produce a password...
However, i do understand the for/while loop itself. I just couldn't figure out how to actaully produce that darn password. I spent hours just staring at my screen. Eventully, I just hope and  prayed an  epiphany would occur and the code would just POP into my brain. I just didn't know how to apply it to a certain area so, I would  greatly appreciate any feedback you give me on how to fix my own.
Please and Thank you!
